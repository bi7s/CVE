# CVE-2020-7949

Valve Dota 2 (schemasystem.dll) before 7.23f allows remote attackers to achieve code execution or denial of service by creating a gaming server and inviting a victim to this server, because a crafted map is mishandled during a GetValue call.

Attacker need invite a victim to play on attacker game server using specially crafted map or create custom game, then when initialize the game of the victim, the specially crafted map will be automatically downloaded and processed by the victim, which will lead to the possibility to exploit vulnerability. Also attacker can create custom map and upload it to [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=328258382).

## Steps for reproduce:

1) Copy attached file [zuff.vpk](zuff.zip) to map directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\maps)
2) Launch Dota2
3) Launch "zuff" map from Dota2 game console. Command for game console = map zuff
4) Dota2 is crash (Access Violation)

```
This means that in the instruction at the address 0x00007ffa5bcf90bf we generate the value of the rbx register from the sum of rsi and rdx. (The rsi register pointing to the area of memory controlled by us (Debug.png); we have full control the dword of the rdx register)

This allows us to intercept the program flow what could lead to remote code execution if attacker will host a malicious server will be able compromise a remote client by having them download a custom map or addons, triggering remote code execution on the victim's computer.
